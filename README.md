## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Developed REST APIs for encryption and decryption using Huffman Encoding.
Achieved an approximate 50% reduction in file size after compression. üíæ‚ú®

More overview about Huffman Encoding : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/huffman-coding-greedy-algo-3/
üõ†Ô∏è Key Highlights:

File Handling: Implemented file handling mechanism for file upload and file creation and writing decrypted text to the created file.

REST APIs: Implemented two APIs : one for encryption and second one for decryption. 

Data Structures: Applied Data structure like min heap for implementing Huffman algorithm .


Check out the project on GitHub: DataZipper-Springboot-Rest-API

Watch the demo here: YouTube Demo

This project has been a great experience in applying the Huffman encoding algorithm within a Spring Boot application.
I‚Äôm enthusiastic about collaborating with other developers on innovative projects and exploring new ideas together!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
